# Interactive-Divisor-Lister

**Description:**
The program prompts for a positive integer, finds its divisors in descending order, and allows repetition. The program terminates on negative/zero input, informs the user of invalid input, and lets them try again.

**Prerequisites:**
Development Environment: 
DEV C++ compiler.
VIsual studio code Editor (uses C/C++ extension from Microsoft)
Online C++ compiler ---- which is easy to use no need of installing anything 

**Installation:**
Follow this link to install IDE (DEV C++) compiler https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVp3uZ8p7UE
ONline compiler https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/

**Usage:**
This program is designed to exhibit the positive divisors of positive integers supplied by you.
The program will repeatedly prompt you to enter a positive integer.
Each time you enter a positive integer, the program will print all the divisors of your integer in a column and in decreasing order.
You can terminate the program by entering 'N' (or 'n') when asked if you want to continue.

**Compiling and Running:**

**Method 1: Using a C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Dev-C++)**
1. **Open the project:** Create a new project in your IDE and add the C++ source files.
2. **Set compiler and linker options:** Ensure that the compiler path, include directories, and library paths are configured correctly.
3. **Build the project:** Click the "Build" or "Compile" button to create the executable.
4. **Run the executable:** Click the "Run" button or execute the executable from the terminal.

**Method 2: Using the command line**
1. **Open a terminal:** Navigate to the directory containing your C++ source file.
2. **Compile the code:** Use a C++ compiler like g++ or clang to compile the code. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
